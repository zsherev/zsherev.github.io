# How I Decide What's Worth Writing About

### **Intro**
- Not sure but I want to soldify it going forward
- Insight over Tutorials
- Explain concepts simply

I want to explain my thought process for deciding what's worth writing about for this blog. During my studies and coding projects, I have visited many blogs for guidance - some were extremely helpful while others were lackluster. From these experiences, I have created two principles for myself: **Insight over Walkthroughs** and **Explain Concepts Simply** to keep my blog aligned with my long-term goals.

## Insight over Walkthroughs
What does this principle mean?

**My goal is to provide professional insights, not rote tutorials**
In practice this means I try to:
- Favor conceptual understanding over step-by-step instructions
- Focus on practical experiences and decision-making
- Explain *why* something is done, not just *how*

There is no shortage of walkthrough-style content in cybersecurity. Many posts describe tool usage in detail—listing flags, commands, and expected output—but stop short of explaining how those tools are actually used in realistic scenarios. As a result, some posts feel hollow: technically correct, but difficult to apply.

A common example is Nmap. Many walkthroughs explain what each flag does and provide example scans. While this is useful for reference, it often lacks context. When should you use a fast scan versus a comprehensive one? How do you correlate results across multiple scans without overwhelming yourself? What does an efficient workflow look like during an engagement or even a CTF?

An insightful post would go a step further. For example, discussing how Zenmap visualizes and aggregates scan results can help beginners understand how to reason about discovered hosts and services, rather than simply memorizing commands. That kind of perspective—how tools fit into a workflow—is what transforms a tutorial into something genuinely useful.

That distinction is what I aim for here.

## Explain Concepts Simply
**If I can’t explain a concept clearly, I don’t understand it well enough yet.**

Cybersecurity has a tendency to become overly dense. Jargon, acronyms, and assumed knowledge can quickly make learning feel inaccessible—especially for beginners. One of the most valuable traits I’ve seen in strong technical writers is the ability to explain complex ideas in plain language without oversimplifying them.

For this blog, that means:
- Writing as if I’m explaining a concept to my past self
- Avoiding unnecessary jargon when a simpler explanation will do
- Breaking ideas down into mental models, not just definitions

This isn’t about “dumbing things down.” It’s about clarity. If a concept can be understood without relying on buzzwords or copy-pasted documentation, it’s far more likely to stick—and far more likely to be useful later in practice.

## How This Shapes What I Publish
These two principles act as a filter. I don’t plan to write about every room I complete, every tool I touch, or every command I run. Some learning is best kept as private notes. What makes it onto the blog should offer something more:

- A shift in understanding
- A connection between concepts
- A lesson learned from practice
- Or insight that might help someone avoid a common mistake

This approach keeps the blog focused, honest, and aligned with my long-term development in offensive security.

## **Conclusion**
Ultimately, this blog is a reflection of how I’m approaching my path into offensive security. As I work through foundational certifications, hands-on labs, and real-world practice, I want this space to document how my understanding evolves—not just what tools I’ve used. By prioritizing insight over walkthroughs and clear explanations over complexity, I’m aiming to build skills that translate beyond certifications and CTFs into real assessments and engagements. This blog will grow alongside my training, and the topics I choose to write about will reflect the areas where learning turns into practical capability.
