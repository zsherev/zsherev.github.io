# Introduction

As I prepare to take my Security+ exam, I wanted to share my process for studying for the foundational IT certifications -- the A+, Network+, and Security+.  

If you've looked for study advice on YouTube, you've seen the clickbait titles:

```nonsense
"How I passed the X certification in a day."`
`"THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK got me certified."`
```

None of that is real. Learning takes time and discipline especially the fundamentals.

During my journey, it was tempting to skip ahead to more advanced content and "cool hacks", but investing in the fundamentals paid off. This post is about how I approached each exam, what worked (and what didn't), and tips I wish I had earlier.

# A+ - Learning, Breaking, and Doing
The A+ was surprisingly fun for me because I focused on _hands-on experience_ instead of pure memorization.

## What I Did
- Learned from Mike Meyers and Professor Messer - structured content includes information the objectives don't
- **Dove into topics I found interesting** even if they were outside A+ objectives
	- (Example: How does the WPA2 handshake actually work?)
- **I broke my own rule** -- I followed a tutorial by David Bombal to do some Wifi-hacking
	- It kept me **motivated** and ground in real-world applications.
- **Volunteered at a Non-profit to dismantle old PCs.** -- Zero risk, high-value experience.
- Took hand-written notes (useful for retention, not great for later review)
- Did a lot of practice tests to reinforce weak areas

## My tips
- Get hands-on experience with real hardware
- **Follow a structured course**
- Do **two passes** on exam material
	- one for understanding, one for refining notes
- Explore deeper topics when curiosity hits

# Network+ - Build Your Own Network
## What I Did
- **Wired a real clinic** -  Invaluable experience in networking.
- Used Cisco Packet Tracer to build small virtual networks
- **Learned Wireshark**, which helped me understand protocols at the packet level
- **Set up VPN connections** for the clinic
- Again: **Professor Messer and Mike Meyers**
- Took practice tests
- Wrote hand-written notes on my first pass through the material then digital notes on the second pass.
- **I finally built my own PC** - an extremely rewarding experience

## My Tips for Network+
- Build small networks—virtual or physical.
- Use Wireshark early. It makes protocols “click.”
- Learn by doing: wiring, configuring, testing.
- Review notes digitally for long-term retention.
- Study real-world scenarios, not just definitions.

# Security+ - A Secure Mindset

## What I Did
- Followed **Professor Messer** for structured coverage
- Deep dives on vulnerabilities
	- Read real CVEs
	- Understood EPSS scores and why severity rankings matter
- Analyze malware samples safely in isolated environments
- Approached security from an attacker's perspective
	- Reconnaissance with **Kali Linux**
	- Basic **Nmap** enumeration and vulnerability scanning
	- **OSINT** via social media, Google dorking, and tools like SpiderFoot or Recon-NG
	- Looked at Metasploit scanners and Bloodhound for AD mapping
- Reviewed legal and regulatory frameworks:
    - Read parts of **HIPAA** and other compliance docs
- Whenever a concept seemed abstract, I searched for a real-world case or breach to connect it to.

### My Tips for Security+
- Don’t memorize definitions—understand **why they matter**.
- Read real vulnerability reports to build intuition.
- Explore recon tools to understand the attacker mindset.
- Learn core compliance frameworks early—they show up everywhere in cybersecurity.
- Find real-world examples for each topic.
