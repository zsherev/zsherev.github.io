Welcome to Sherev Security Lab — a collection of technical research, offensive security notes, and practical insights from my work in cybersecurity. Here I document the methods, tools, and thought processes behind penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and hands-on security learning.

This site serves as both a personal notebook and a public resource, focused on clarity, methodology, and real-world application. Whether through writeups, scripting projects, or research posts, my goal is to contribute meaningful, high-quality content to the cybersecurity community.
