I’m Z — a cybersecurity student and aspiring penetration tester. I’ve earned A+, Network+, and Security+ and I am current studyings Linux+, and Pentest+. I’m learning hands-on skills through TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and offensive security courses while working toward the OSCP.

This site documents my labs, writeups, and progress as I build toward a future career—and eventually my own pentesting business.
